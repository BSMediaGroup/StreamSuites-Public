It will read runtime state and write configuration locally, then hand changes back to the runtime without bypassing safety. No UI bindings or remote control paths are assumed; the entry documents the active development of a local-only foundation with later parity targets for macOS and Linux. The dashboard only surfaces this active work; no UI controls are wired yet.",

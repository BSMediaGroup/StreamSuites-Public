            <li><strong>What we store</strong>: the provider ID, linkage metadata, and (when required for operations) tokens/scopes to access connected features you enable.</li>
            <li><strong>Scope minimization</strong>: we request only the permissions needed to operate the features you choose to enable.</li>
            <li><strong>Revocation</strong>: you can often revoke access from within the third-party provider’s account settings; revocation may disable connected features in StreamSuites.</li>

            StreamSuites relies on third-party services to deliver the platform. These providers may process personal information
            on our behalf (for example, IP address, device information, email addresses, transaction metadata, and operational logs).
          </p>
          <ul class="public-list">

              <strong>Cloudflare (CDN, DNS, security, bot mitigation)</strong>:
              helps deliver public pages and APIs, improve performance, and protect against malicious traffic. Cloudflare may process network metadata
              (such as IP address, request headers, and security signals) and may set security-related cookies.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Hetzner (hosting / VPS / cloud infrastructure)</strong>:

            <li>
              <strong>Stripe (payments)</strong>:
              processes subscription payments and optional one-off donations. Stripe processes payment card data and transaction details.
